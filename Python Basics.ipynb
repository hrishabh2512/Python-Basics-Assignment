    "#PYTHON BASICS QUESTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "   - Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simple,\n",
    "     readable syntax, making it easy for beginners, but powerful enough for complex\n",
    "     tasks like web development, data science, AI, and automation, thanks to extensive\n",
    "     libraries, a strong community, and cross-platform compatibility, making it\n",
    "     popular across many industries. \n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "   - A Python interpreter is a program that directly reads and executes Python code.\n",
    "     It acts as both a translator and a runtime environment, processing instructions\n",
    "     written in the high-level Python language line-by-line (conceptually) and converting\n",
    "     them into machine-readable code that your computer's processor can execute. \n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "   - Python's pre-defined keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings\n",
    "     and purposes integral to the language's syntax and structure. They cannot be used as\n",
    "     identifiers, such as names for variables, functions, or classes. \n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "   - No, you generally cannot use keywords as variable names in programming languages because\n",
    "     they are reserved words with special, predefined meanings for the compiler or interpreter,\n",
    "     and using them causes syntax errors. Keywords like if, return, class, int, or for define \n",
    "     the language's structure and function, so you must use alternative, valid identifiers \n",
    "     (like my_if or for_loop) for your variables.\n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "   - In Python, mutability refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it has been\n",
    "     created. Mutable objects allow changes to their internal state or contents without changing\n",
    "     their unique identity (memory address). \n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "   - Lists are mutable because they are designed for dynamic collections where elements are\n",
    "     frequently added, removed, or changed, while tuples are immutable to provide data integrity,\n",
    "     performance benefits, and allow them to be used as dictionary keys, acting as fixed records \n",
    "     or constants. The core difference is intent: lists for changeable data, tuples for unchangeable\n",
    "     data, offering guarantees against accidental modification and enabling efficient hashing for\n",
    "     dictionary keys. \n",
    "7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python?\n",
    "   - The primary difference between Python's == and is operators is that == checks for value equality\n",
    "     (whether two objects have the same value), while is checks for identity equality (whether two \n",
    "     objects are the same actual object in memory) [1, 2]. \n",
    "8. What are the logical operators in python?\n",
    "   - Python has three logical operators: and, or, and not. These operators are used to combine \n",
    "     conditional statements and return a Boolean result (True or False), which is essential for\n",
    "     controlling the flow of a program. \n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another,\n",
    "   which is essential for ensuring data compatibility and performing operations correctly. \n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "   - Implicit type conversion (coercion) is automatic, safe, and done by the compiler for \n",
    "     widening types (e.g., int to float), while explicit conversion (casting) requires the \n",
    "     programmer's direct command (e.g., (int)float_value) to force conversion, often for \n",
    "     narrowing types (e.g., float to int), risking data loss but giving control. \n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "    - Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program's execution\n",
    "      by making decisions based on whether a specified condition (a Boolean expression)\n",
    "      evaluates to True or False. They allow programs to be dynamic, responding differently\n",
    "      to various inputs or scenarios. \n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
    "    - The elif statement (short for \"else if\") is used to check multiple conditions in a\n",
    "      sequence, after an initial if condition has been found to be false. The first condition\n",
    "      that evaluates to True will have its corresponding code block executed, and the rest of\n",
    "      the elif and else conditions in the sequence will be skipped. \n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "    - For loops are best for a known number of iterations, bundling initialization, condition,\n",
    "      and increment in one line (e.g., iterating through a list), while while loops are for an\n",
    "      unknown number of repetitions, running as long as a condition is true, making them ideal\n",
    "      for waiting on user input or external events where the exit point isn't fixed. Think for\n",
    "      when you know how many times, and while when you know when to stop. \n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "    - A scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop is when the number of\n",
    "      iterations required is not known in advance, and the loop needs to continue based on\n",
    "      a condition that changes dynamically during execution. A classic example is a program \n",
    "      that reads user input until a specific exit command is entered.  \n",
    "      In this scenario, a for loop is difficult to use because there is no pre-defined range\n",
    "      of numbers or collection to iterate over. You don't know if the user will enter one\n",
    "      value or a hundred before deciding to exit. \n",
